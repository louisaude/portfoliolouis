    <h1>Hi! I'm Louis.</h1>
    This website is still under construction. Watch your head for falling mortar
    and don't mind the occasional typos. <br />
    I started learning coding a few months ago and went through a bootcamp. I am
    now eager to get some real experience and I'm looking for an internship, or
    a junior position as a web developer. I am based in Berlin, but open to
    working remotely.

<!-- what about me -->

  <div class="container textbox">
    <h1>What about me?</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a French expat/immigrant who's decided at 30 that he wants to be a
      developer. Before, I've worked all sorts of jobs, from manual labor to
      business development to sales, retail, and customer service management. I
      have little experience coding but a lot of soft skills picked up along my
      career. And I'll put in the work to make that reconversion successful.

<!-- career change -->
<section>
  <div class="container textbox">
    <h1>So why the career change?</h1>
    <p>
      I worked in startups before, not as, but with developers and that got me
      interested in their role within a company. My previous missions were
      operational, sometimes strategic, and for the most part, interesting. But
      I'm interested in working on the product. Actually creating the product,
      getting your hands dirty. And the process of it, the problem solving, the
      continuous learning, are icing on the cake. That's what developers do.
      That's what I want to do.

      , I was taught the core concepts of coding, before having to put them in
      practice to solve coding challenges at first, and to then to code Ruby on
      Rails apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bootcamp focuses on Ruby on Rails, with a zest of Javascript. It was
      quite intense. I got to learn HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, hosting, Scraping,
      working as a team on Git, building relational databases with SQL. I also
      got to code and build a few apps, solo and in teams, that you'll be able
      to consult on my <a href="/#projects">projects page</a>.
