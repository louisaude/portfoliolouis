  <h1>Hi! I'm Louis.</h1>
  <p>I'm looking for an internship, or a junior position, as a backend or fullstack web developer. 
    If you'd like to cut to the chase, no hard feelings, go straight to my portfolio or consult my CV.
    If you'd like to know more about me, go to the about page.</p>

  <h1>What about me?</h1>
  <p>I'm a French expat/immigrant (I swear I don't have an annoying French accent) who's decided at 30 that he wants to be a developer. I worked all sorts of summer jobs and temp jobs, before obtaining a master's degree in business management and working in business counselling, then customer service, then customer service management. I may be new to coding, but I'm not new to rolling up my sleeves, and this choice of reconversion is thought out, and I intend to put in the work to make it happen.</p>

  <h1>So why the career change?</h1>
  <p>My underwhelming German ( but I'm working on it) and my personal interests me naturally steered me towards working for startups. There, I got to work with teams of developers ( usually as the guy bringing up customer complaints ) and figuratively look over the shoulder of my colleagues. And I wanted in. I really liked my previous jobs, and most of the people I worked with, but managing a team of customer service agents is very day to day, operational stuff. Bringing in issues, and talking about them on a theoretical level is just not enough. I like getting my hands dirty, being part of the creation process and in startups, that means being a developer. 
  That's what got me interested. Then, the problem solving, the continuous learning, the intellectual stimulation tipped me over. 
  When my company went out of business last summer ( though not because of corona), I decided to give it a go.  </p>

  <h1>What do I bring to the table?</h1>
  <p>I want to make a career change, and I'm not getting any younger. I do not have the best developing skills in town, but I have <i>some</i> coding skills, and a strong desire to make that career change a successful one. I will work hard, receive feedback eagerly and apply any advice I will receive. And I like to think I did pick up some soft skills during  the 13 years I've been working ( I did not least every single summer job on my resume as it would be quite a tedious read), soft skills that will make me a pleasure to work with, I swear.
  I followed Le Wagon, a full stack development bootcamp focused on Ruby on Rails, with a zest of Javascript. It was quite intense. I got to learn HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, hosting, Scraping, working as a team on Git, building relational databases with SQL. I also got to code and build a few apps, solo and in teams, that you'll be able to consult on my <strong>portfolio page</strong></p>
