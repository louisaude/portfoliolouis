  <h1>Hi! I'm Louis.</h1>
  <p>I'm looking for an internship, or a junior position, as a backend or fullstack web developer. 
    If you'd like to cut to the chase, no hard feelings, have a look at my portfolio or consult my CVs ( the one that's tech focused, and the one that's not).
    If you'd like to know more about me, go to the about page.</p>
