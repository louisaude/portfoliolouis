  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <p>I'm a French expat/immigrant (I swear I don't have an annoying French accent) who's decided at 30 that he wants to be a developer. I worked all sorts of summer jobs and temp jobs, before obtaining a master's degree in business management and working in business counselling, then customer service, then customer service management. I may be new to coding, but I'm not new to rolling up my sleeves, and this choice of reconversion is thought out, and I intend to put in the work to make it happen.</p>

  <h1>So why the career change?</h1>
  <p>My underwhelming German ( but I'm working on it) and my personal interests me naturally steered me towards working for startups. There, I got to work with teams of developers ( usually as the guy bringing up customer complaints ) and figuratively look over the shoulder of my colleagues. And I wanted in. I really liked my previous jobs, and most of the people I worked with, but managing a team of customer service agents is very day to day, operational stuff. Bringing in issues, and talking about them on a theoretical level is just not enough. I like getting my hands dirty, being part of the creation process and in startups, that means being a developer. 
  That's what got me interested. Then, the problem solving, the continuous learning, the intellectual stimulation tipped me over. 
  When my company went out of business last summer ( though not because of corona), I decided to give it a go.  </p>

  <h1>What do I bring to the table?</h1>
  <p>I'm not gonna sit there and pretend I'm the best developer you can find in Berlin. I did follow Le Wagon, a full stack development bootcamp focused on Ruby on Rails, with a zest of Javascript. It was quite intense. I got to learn HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, hosting, Scraping, working as a team on Git, building relational databases with SQL. I also got to code and build a few apps, solo and in teams, that you'll be able to consult on my <strong>portfolio page</strong></p>
